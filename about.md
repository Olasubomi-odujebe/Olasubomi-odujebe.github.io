Welcome to my professional space on the web! I am Olasubomi, a detail-oriented and data-driven finance analyst currently deepening my expertise in financial analytics through a Master's program at Trent University.

With a robust foundation in banking and finance from Babcock University and diverse roles spanning from front-end retail operations to sophisticated financial analysis, I bring a unique blend of practical and analytical skills to the table. My journey has taken me from bustling markets in Lagos, Nigeria to the serene environment of Peterborough, Canada, where I continue to develop my technical skills and contribute to my community.

### What Drives Me

I am passionately driven by the power of data to transform businesses and the broader economy. With technical proficiency in tools like Python, R, and various data visualization platforms, I aspire to unravel complex financial data into actionable insights. My work across different sectors has instilled a deep appreciation for how financial data informs business strategies and operations.

### Beyond Work

Outside the professional realm,I am a Fashion designer and I engage actively in community service, contributing my time to the Peterborough Public Library and participating in local events planning. These experiences enrich my understanding of community dynamics and the importance of civic engagement.
